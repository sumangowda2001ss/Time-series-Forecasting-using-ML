**OBJECTIVE**: A utility company wanted to predict the electricity demand accurately to optimize power generation and  distribution.

**APPROACH** Time series data from past yers, including historical demand, weather data, and holidays,
was collected . SARIMA and Prophel models were used to capture seasonality and trends.
DeepAR was applied for probabilistic forecasting with prediction intervals.

**Outcomes**: The accurate forecast enabled the utility company to optimize power generation, reduce operational cost,
and prevent energy shortages during peak demand periods.
